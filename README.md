# jlab-script-button

A JupyterLab extension that adds a button which can be used to execute scripts in the frontend of JupyterLab.

## Usage

Adds a button into the notebook toolbar. Pushing the button starts a temporary python3 kernel named "tmp\_kernel\_for\_executing\_button\_code", which executes the following:

```bash
![ -z $BUTTON_EXTENSION_SCRIPT_PATH ] && jlab_button_script [notebook_path] \ 
                                      || eval $BUTTON_EXTENSION_SCRIPT_PATH [notebook_path]
```
So if ```$BUTTON_EXTENSION_SCRIPT_PATH``` is defined, the button runs the script at said path with the notebook's path as the argument. Otherwise the default script ```jlab_button_script``` is used.

# Rebuild JupyterLab after making any changes
jupyter lab build
```

You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab in watch mode to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension and application.

```bash
# Watch the source directory in another terminal tab
jlpm watch
# Run jupyterlab in watch mode in one terminal tab
jupyter lab --watch
```
